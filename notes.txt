Chapter 2
 - to compile a c program: cc -std=c99 -Wall hello_world.c -o hello_world
 - to run a compiled c program: ./hello_world
 
Chapter 3
  - syntax and stuff
  
Chapter 4 Interactive prompt
  - compiling with readline edit: cc -std=c99 -Wall prompt.c -ledit -o prompt
  - The C Preprocessor - will allow us to compile for different platforms
    - uses the # and ifdef to help with preprocessing comands
    
Chapter 5 Grammer and Such
    - use of mpc
  
Chapter 6 Parsing
    -Polish Notation
        - 1 + 2 + 6 is + 1 2 6
        - Operator always comes first in an expression, followed by either numbers or other expressions in parentheses
        - a program is an operator followed by one or more expressiohns
        - where an expression is either a numer, or, in parnentheses, an operator followed by one or more expressions
        - summary:
            -"Program" - the start of input, an "Operator", one or more "Expression", and the end of input
            - "Expression" - either a "Number" or '(', an "Operator", one or more "Expresion", and an ')'
            - "Operator" - '+', '-', '*', or '/'
            - "Number" - an optional '-', and one or more charaters between 0 and 9  
    -Regular Expressions
        - a way of writing gramer for small sections of text, such as words or numbers
        -examples:
            - .         Any Character is required
            - a         The character a is required
            - [abcdef]  Any Character in the set abcdef is required
            - [a-f]     Any character in the range a to f is required
            - a?        The character a is optional
            - a*        Zero or more of the character a are required
            - a+        One or more of the character a are required 
            - ^         The start of input is required
            - $         The end of input is required
            - /         Surrounds the regular expression in mpc
        - number rule in regular expression: /-?[0-9]+/
    -Installing mpc
        - Download mpc.h and mpc.c from repo
        - place in directory of source file
        - add '#include "mpc.h"' to sourcde file
        - linux/Mac compile: cc -std=c99 -Wall parsing.c mpc.c -ledit -lm -o parsing
        - windows compile: cc -std=c99 -Wall parsing.c mpc.c -o parsing
